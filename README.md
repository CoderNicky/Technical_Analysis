## Introduction

Algorithmic trading aims to automate the process of buying and selling financial instruments based on predefined criteria. This repository focuses on the development of buy signals through technical analysis, allowing algorithmic trading bots to make informed decisions.

## Indicators and Signals

The scripts utilize a variety of technical indicators and signals, including but not limited to:
- Moving Averages
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- Bollinger Bands
- and more...

The combination of these indicators helps identify potential entry points for long-term positions.

## Scripts

- [macd_strategy.py](macd_strategy.py): Implements a trading strategy based on MACD crossovers.
- [rsi_strategy.py](rsi_strategy.py): Implements a trading strategy based on RSI levels.
- [moving_average_strategy.py](moving_average_strategy.py): Implements a trading strategy based on moving average crossovers.

Feel free to explore and modify these scripts to suit your specific requirements.
